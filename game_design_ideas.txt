Basic overview of the game as it is:
Platformer side-scroller
made in Godot

1-4 players
ability to switch between characters
characters have unique abilities
3 stages to the game: tutorial, main stage, boss level
Unique abilities apply to both puzzles and combat
starting abilities ideas: whip, projectile, magic, barbarian, grower/shrinker, universal stomp
enemies have vulnerabilities to certain characters
enemies are color-coded to the characters that can kill them
Anyone can swap to extra characters
All characters are in the world, even when they aren't being controlled

Logan's preferences:
I'd like the project to be in C# or at least not GDscript
I'd like the game to not take itself seriously, in the style of Undertale and Deltarune
